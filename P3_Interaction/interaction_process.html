    <h1 class="heading">P3: Interaction â€” Process</h1><br>

    <h1 class="heading">Ideation</h1>
    <p class="writeup">I did a project on TouchDesigner a few months ago called Sillage, where the user interacts with a
        dynamic display on their laptop screens. The visual consisted of a waterfall of glowing blue particles with a
        deep blue and purple trail, and the user waves their hands in front of the webcam to make the visuals move. </p>

    <p class="writeup">Since this project had a similar brief, I decided to jump off of that project and decided to
        create something similar. I was assigned the "resize" interaction, and I wanted to create a similar abstract
        site. So I decided to, again, create a piece of generative art with trails and particles, but
        adapt it to the medium of the web using HTML, CSS and Javascript so that the particle flow changes when the
        browser window is resized.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Process</h1>

    <p class="writeup"> I decided to first create the entire flow field, and then link the necessary parameters to the
        browser window size. I did this by first dividing the entire canvas into a grid. The basic logic behind the
        particle movement is that all the particles will flow in one direction in any given grid square, and all of
        these grid squares put together would create the illusion of movement. </p><br>

    <h2 class="heading">Setting up the Particle System</h2>
    <p class="writeup">Since the particles have to cover the whole screen, I assigned random x and y coordinates for
        their origins. I also assigned all of them random speeds, so that the effect seems more natural. An array was
        then created to keep track of all of the positions of the particles, and then all these positions were accessed
        by looping through the array to create a path. To set the colors of the particle system, another array with the
        three colors (turquoise, purple and blue) was created and the particles were randomly assigned one of these
        colors.<br>
        <img src="Particleclass1.png" class="image"><br>
        I also wanted to have the particles follow a mathematical curve, a combination of a sine curve and a cosine
        curve, so an angle was also defined at this point that would affect the movement. So far, the particles left
        behind a path as they moved, but the effect of movement wasn't created as the drawn path remained static. To
        create the effect of a disappearing trail, the shitf() function was used to continuously delete one segment from
        the beginning of the path and the push() function was used to continuously add a segment at the end of the path.
        This updates continuously in a loop, giving the effect of a disappearing trail. A reset() function is then
        defined to reset this animation loop.
    </p><br>

    <h2 class="heading">Managing Particle Behaviour</h2>
    <p class="writeup">In a constructor method, a few basic parameters were defined such as the number of particles,
        grid size, curve of the path, the zoom factor, and an array that held the angle values for the individual grid
        cells. <br>
        Then, to create set the path and direct the flow of particles, I set the mathematical equation of the curve
        within the nested for loops created to access the grid squares</p><br>

    <h2 class="heading">Incorporating Resize</h2>

    <p class="writeup">Initially, I wanted to use a javascript library to make interaction easier, but then I realised
        that adding this interaction was easy enough in Vanilla Javascript as well. A resize function was added within
        the Effect Class right after the code that defined the path of the particles. Each time the window is resized,
        the width and height of the canvas is updated to the new height and width of the window. An event listener was
        also added for the window resize. Within this resize function, the initialize function is called at the very end
        so that the browser refreshes every time the window is resized and displays the pattern. To change the pattern
        being displayed, however, I linked three curve parameters to the width of the window, so that they change
        dynamically: the curve, the zoom and the grid size. Hence, now the pattern of the flow field depends on the
        width of the browser window. </p><br>

    <h1 class="heading">Final Output</h1>
    <p class="writeup">Here are a few screengrabs of some of the patterns at different window widths.</p>
